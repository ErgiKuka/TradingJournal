## Recommended Display Settings (Important)

To get the cleanest layout (especially dashboards/tables), please use:

- **Resolution:** `1920 × 1080`
- **Windows display scaling:** `100%`

### Windows quick steps
**Settings → System → Display**
- Set **Display resolution** to **1920 × 1080**
- Set **Scale** to **100%**

> Using 125% / 150% / 200% scaling can cause UI spacing to look off or feel cramped.
